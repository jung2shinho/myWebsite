# My Portfolio Website
This is my software engineering / data scientist portfolio website.
Utilizes React and Three.js

# React Notes:
- React Hooks need be within a function component.
- React Hooks need to be run in order. Cannot be in if-else statements.
i.e [currentState, updatedState] =useState(4)
- React Hooks always returns an array with two values.
- Props cannot be changed in function.
- Props are passed into component vs State is managed within the component.
